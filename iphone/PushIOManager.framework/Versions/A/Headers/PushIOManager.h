// IMPORTANT: To use the Push IO service, you are required to have a PushIO API key. You can
// obtain this by setting up an account and adding an app at https://manage.push.io
//
// After you add an app, set up your iOS platform via the "Set Up" section. You will then see a link
// to download a "pushio_config.json" file, which contains your API Key.  
//
// Place this file in your project alongside the AppDelegate (so that it is included in your application bundle).

// If you subscribe to these notification you'll be notified when a push is processed by this library, or the system has registered.
// You can also get the same information by setting a delegate for PushIOManager, described below.
